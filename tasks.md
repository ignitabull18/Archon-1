Okay, based on the analysis of the provided notepads and the sequential thinking process, here is a task list for incorporating Composio into the Agent Army system:

**Task List: Integrating Composio into Agent Army**

1.  **Set Up Composio:**
    *   Sign up for Composio ([composio.dev](https://composio.dev/)).
    *   Use the Composio platform/dashboard to provision and configure managed MCP servers for each required external service (e.g., GitHub, Slack, AirTable, Brave Search, Firecrawl).
    *   Obtain the specific MCP HTTP/SSE URL and any necessary API keys/authentication tokens provided by Composio for each service.

2.  **Configure Environment:**
    *   Store the obtained Composio MCP URLs and API keys securely as system environment variables (e.g., `COMPOSIO_GITHUB_MCP_URL`, `COMPOSIO_SLACK_MCP_URL`, `COMPOSIO_API_KEY`). **Do not** commit these to version control.
    *   Ensure the Python environment (managed by `uv`) includes `pydantic-ai[mcp]` and `termcolor`. Update `requirements.txt` accordingly (without version pins).

3.  **Update Project Configuration (`agent_army_app/config.py` or equivalent):**
    *   Modify the configuration loading mechanism to read the Composio MCP URLs and API keys from the environment variables using `os.getenv()`.
    *   Define constants for these configuration values if not already done.

4.  **Refactor Sub-Agents (`agent_army_app/sub_agents.py`):**
    *   For each specialized sub-agent (e.g., `github_agent`, `slack_agent`):
        *   Remove any existing `MCPServerStdio` or manual MCP server configurations.
        *   Import `MCPServerHTTP` from `pydantic_ai.mcp`.
        *   Instantiate the MCP connection using `MCPServerHTTP`, passing the corresponding Composio URL loaded from the configuration (`config.COMPOSIO_GITHUB_MCP_URL`, etc.).
        *   Ensure the `mcp_servers` list in the `Agent` constructor for each sub-agent contains *only* its specific `MCPServerHTTP` instance pointing to the Composio endpoint.

5.  **Verify Primary Agent (`agent_army_app/primary_agent.py`):**
    *   Confirm that the primary agent does *not* have any `mcp_servers` configured directly.
    *   Ensure the wrapper tool functions (e.g., `use_github_service`) correctly call the `.run()` method of the respective refactored sub-agents. The docstrings for these tools remain crucial for routing.

6.  **Update Main Execution Logic (`agent_army_app/main.py`):**
    *   Modify the logic that gathers MCP server instances to correctly collect the `MCPServerHTTP` objects from the updated sub-agents.
    *   Ensure the `async with mcp_connection_manager.run_mcp_servers():` block correctly manages the connections to the Composio endpoints via the `MCPServerHTTP` instances.

7.  **Testing:**
    *   Thoroughly test the Agent Army by sending requests that require delegation to various sub-agents.
    *   Verify that the sub-agents successfully communicate with their respective services via the Composio MCP endpoints.
    *   Check error handling and logging.

8.  **(Optional) Update Archon:**
    *   Consider if Archon's internal resources (`agent_resources/mcps`) should be updated with examples of Composio configurations.
    *   Refine the prompts used to instruct Archon to generate code that utilizes Composio by default (specifying `MCPServerHTTP` and placeholders for Composio URLs/keys).
